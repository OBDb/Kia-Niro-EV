    description: "The original Kia Niro EV (sold as the e-Niro in some markets) was the all-electric variant of the first-generation Niro crossover. Sharing its basic styling with the hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions but with distinctive blue accents, a closed grille, and unique wheels for improved aerodynamics. Powered by a 201 HP (150 kW) electric motor driving the front wheels, paired with either a 39.2 kWh battery offering approximately 153 miles of range or a larger 64 kWh battery providing up to 239 miles of range (EPA rated). DC fast charging allowed an 80% charge in about 54 minutes with a 100 kW charger. The interior was largely shared with other Niro variants but featured EV-specific displays, blue accent trim, and a shift-by-wire rotary gear selector in place of the traditional shift lever. Available features included an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system (later upgraded to 10.25 inches), wireless phone charging, heated and ventilated seats, and a suite of advanced driver assistance systems. Despite its crossover styling, the Niro EV was only available with front-wheel drive. This generation established the Niro EV as a practical, relatively affordable electric vehicle that combined crossover utility with zero-emission driving, offering impressive range for its time without the polarizing styling of some dedicated electric vehicles."

    description: "The current Niro EV features dramatically more distinctive styling inspired by the 2019 HabaNiro concept, with a bold two-tone design incorporating a contrasting 'Aero Blade' C-pillar, angular 'heartbeat' LED daytime running lights, and a more assertive front end. While maintaining similar dimensions to its predecessor, the new design gives it a more substantial presence. Powered by a refined electric powertrain with the same 201 HP (150 kW) output but paired with a slightly larger 64.8 kWh battery, it offers an EPA-estimated range of up to 253 miles. Charging capabilities include up to 85 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in under 45 minutes. The interior represents a major advancement with a curved display combining a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, ambient lighting, and sustainable materials including recycled wallpaper headliner and seat upholstery made from eucalyptus leaves. New technology includes Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) functionality allowing the car to power external devices up to 3.6 kW, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and an expanded suite of driver assistance features branded as DriveWise. Slightly larger than its predecessor, it offers improved passenger space and cargo capacity. The second-generation Niro EV balances practical electric mobility with more distinctive styling and advanced technology, positioned as a versatile, feature-rich electric crossover at a more accessible price point than Kia's dedicated electric vehicles like the EV6."
